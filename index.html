    <h4>
      I'm a software engineer
    </h4>
 
    <p>
     I studied abroad in Hong Kong (HKUST) 
      my senior year of college (B.S. Information and Process Management, aka Information Systems, at Indiana University). 
      I worked with a small, elite team to build a wearable device for about a year and a half as soon as I finished up my studies.
       I came back to the U.S. and proceeded to promote the work of (mostly) emerging artists from around the world. 
       This took shape through Nava, Kyle Bradley (projects), and A2C.

      I deeply appreciate and enjoy fine art. One day I'd like to see more artists sustaining themselves
       through sales to collectors. I'm currently living in Los Angeles and work as a Senior Frontend Engineer at
       <a href="https://www.eatstellarpizza.com/" target="_blank">Stellar</a>. Outside of work, I like to walk backwards, blow bubbles, and <a href="https://kylebradley.art/" target="_blank">take photographs</a>
